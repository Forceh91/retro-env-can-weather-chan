# DJR End User License Agreement

## Multi-use License

This End User License Agreement is a legal agreement between you and DJR (David Jonathan Ross). Please read it carefully.

When you purchase a font from DJR, you are granted a non-exclusive license to use the font in your work.

This agreement takes effect when you download or use the font. If you do not agree to or understand these terms, do not download and/or use the font.

Fonts: For the purposes of this license, a “font” is defined as the font software, the designs embodied therein, and all supplemental materials provided along with the font software, as well as any future versions or upgrades.

Limitations: For the purposes of this license, the “limitations” are defined in your order summary, which governs the maximum number of allowed installations on desktop computers, unique website visitors, and number of mobile apps and e-books. If you do not have an Order Summary, or a type of use is not identified, the assumed limitation is zero (0) and you are not permitted to use the font in that way. All rights not granted to you are expressly reserved to DJR.


## General Terms

You are permitted to use the font for personal and internal business use.

Protection: This font is protected under United States copyright and trademark law.

Distribution: Except in very specific instances described and permitted in this license, you may not distribute (share, rent, lend, give away, or sell) the font. You agree to take all reasonable steps to prevent others from accessing, distributing, or re-serving the font file.

Modifications: Conversion to outlined vector files is permitted. You may also modify the font software itself, as long as it is for your own purposes only and you do not distribute the modified font or the software. Any derived versions from the font remain the property of DJR and are subject to the same license. Please contact DJR and explain the nature of the modification.

License transfer: You are allowed to transfer this license to another individual, company, or organization so long as they following conditions are met:

* The transferee must agree to the terms of this license.
* You must destroy all copies of the font that you possess or control.
* You must notify DJR of the transfer and provide the name and contact information for the transferee.

Upgrades: If any of your uses exceed of your defined limitations, you must purchase an upgrade to your license.

Testing: If your Order Summary includes the phrase “For Testing Purposes Only” or does not explicitly define limitations, you are restricted to using the font for internal testing purposes only. You must upgrade to a full and appropriate license before delivering any work that uses the font.

Special Uses: You must obtain a special upgrade if you wish to use the font in any way not identified in your license or limitations. You must also obtain a special upgrade if you wish to use the font in such a way that an unlicensed user has access to the alphabet in full, or in a product where an end-user can set type using the font or its design or distribute products with customized uses of the font.

Credit: You are not obligated to include a colophon or credit the font or DJR, but are more than welcome to do so.


## Terms of Desktop Use

This license allows you to install and use the font on a limited number of workstations defined in your order summary. All of these workstations must belong to the same individual, company, or organization that is licensing the font.

Document Embedding: You are allowed to embed the font in document formats that allow embedding, such as PDF. The font must be embedded in such a way that the reader is restricted from changing its embedding permissions, extracting the complete font from the document, and create or edit new content using the font. Embedding in mobile apps or e-books is subject to a separate set of terms and is subject to separate limitations.

Service Bureaus: If printing from an embedded PDF is not an option, you are permitted to send the font to a printer or service bureau that is creating the final output of your design. When the service bureau is finished printing your job, they must destroy all copies of the font.

Internal Servers: You may install the font on an internal server as long as you do not exceed the total number of users defined in your order summary.

Backups: You may create a copy of the desktop font for backup purposes, as long as the backup copy cannot be accessed by anyone other than licensed users.


## Terms of Web Use

This license allows you to use the font on websites using CSS @font-face, so long as that website meets the web traffic limits defined in your order summary.

Traffic: You are allowed to serve the font file on a website that receives a limited number of unique visitors per month as defined in your order summary. If you exceed the limit for three consecutive months, you must upgrade your license. DJR reserves the right to inspect or monitor your use.

Domains: You are required to identify and register all domains where the font is served via @font-face with DJR. You may contact DJR at any time to register additional domains. You are not limited to a the number of domains or subdomains, so long as all websites using the font are operated by the licensee, and the cumulative traffic does not exceed your web traffic limitation. 

Formats: For web use, you are limited to serving the font in WOFF, WOFF2, EOT, and SVG formats. You may not use desktop formats like OTF and TTF. If you have questions, contact DJR for information.

Server: You must host the font on your website’s server or on a CDN (content delivery network) where you host other website assets. You must make a reasonable effort to prevent unlicensed use of the fonts by other people.

Hosted Services: In addition to hosting the font yourself, you are also permitted to host the font via a hosted-service where DJR has made the font available. You may not add the font to any public webfont-hosting service yourself, or host it in a way that allows for unauthorized use.


## Terms of Mobile App / E-Book Use

This license allows you to distribute the font by embedding it in a limited number of mobile apps or e-books specified in your order summary.

Platforms: Platform-specific versions with the same name and functionality may be counted together as a single app. On each platform, you must make a reasonable effort to secure the font and prevent it from unauthorized use.


## Finally

Rights: DJR reserves all rights not otherwise specified, makes no guarantees, and disclaims all warranties except those proscribed by law.

Liability: Under no circumstances is DJR responsible or liable for any issues or harm or physical damages that may result from the use of the font, even if notified in advance.

If you encounter a problem with the font, DJR will make a good faith effort to provide you with documentation and support. If no solution can be found, DJR may offer you the option to terminate the license in exchange for a refund. A refund is not guaranteed and is completely up to DJR’s discretion.

Termination: DJR reserves the right to terminate this license if you breach any term without the obligation of notice or opportunity to cure. If your license is terminated, you are obligated to destroy all copies of the font that you possess.

Grounds for termination include:

* Using the font outside of the terms set in this license
* Exceeding the agreed-upon limitations without purchasing an upgrade
* Unauthorized distribution of the font or other breaches of the terms stated above

If possible, DJR will make a good faith effort to allow you to upgrade your license so that you can operate within its terms.
